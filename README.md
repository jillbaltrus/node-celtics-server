# node-celtics-server
Welcome to my Celtics Server, which I built for <a href="https://github.com/jillbaltrus/everything-celtics-app">
  this project
</a>.
I decided to build my own server in between my React Native app and the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba">Rapid7 NBA API</a>
simply for the learning experience and to have better control over the exact calls I was making to the third party API. My API has several
GET calls implemented that allow users to discover NBA stats, players, games and team info. Although I'm using it purely for Celtics, it's
versatile enough to be used for any NBA team.
